Just import your proxy's certificate into all utilized instances of "cacerts" keystores.

You likely have a proxy which is intercepting (via MITM) your traffic. Locate your network's certificate: In a browser,
navigate to "https://www.google.com" hit F12, go to certificates/security and get the top most certificate...
Export it to MyCertificate.cer (base64 encoded). This process is different for each OS and Browser.
If you're on a linux/mac something like echo -n | openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/MyCertificate.cer
should get the certificate for you in a terminal (assuming you have your distributions net-utils package installed).
In a terminal, navigate to your Jetbrains installation (whichever IDE it is doesn't matter). Inside of the base folder
navigate to the folder "jre64" or "jre32" or "jre" -> "lib" -> "security"
Copy over MyCertificate.cer into the security folder. (mv /tmp/MyCertificate.cer)
Type "keytool -keystore cacerts -importcert -alias MyCertificate -file MyCertificate.cer" without quotes.

Use the default password of "changeit" (Without quotes, obviously.)

When prompted to trust the certificate type "yes" (Without quotes...). Hit enter.

Restart the IDE in question and it should now function normally. Repeat this process for all java (including jdk)
installations and jetbrains tools just to be safe. The relative path is the same regardless: jre -> lib -> security
If keytool is not found, you're probably on windows so try
"%JAVA_HOME%/jre/bin/keytool" -keystore cacerts -importcert -alias MyCertificate -file MyCertificate.cer
Otherwise, locate your keytool in wherever you have java installed or use the one in "jre(64|32)?" -> "bin"
